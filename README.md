# RPG Resume
This project is an RPG style interactive resume. There are two general goals for this project: To learn and to stand out

## The Learning Experience
In the interest of acquiring new skills, as well as honing existing ones. I wanted to practice key aspects of the development process. I primarily focus on practicing my coding skills, while learning best practices of versioning the project with git. This includes creating issues, and making new branches for each of those, carefully documenting changes to the code base. This project isn't really big enough for this to be strictly necessary, but again, this is for learning.

## Standing Out
As a newly graduated MSc in Digital Design and Information Technology, there is a fair bit of competition on the job market. This resume could serve as a sort of portfolio/proof of competence, hopefully granting me an edge over my recently graduated peers. At least that's the idea.

## Description
The resume is set up like a sidescrolling RPG. The character can freely walk around the play area using the arrow keys. Getting close to objects in the game will prompt a text box popup, explaining some aspect of my professional, academic or personal profile. Navigation is not strictly necessary, as the game world is quite small, but for convenience the player starts right next to a sign, that points in the general direction of different topics. A sort of gamified table of contents, if you will.

I hope you enjoy my little game, and I urge you to check out the commit history and issues, which are very much part of my skillset. This is written before I have started working with these things, so hopefully future me has the brain cells to actually execute this properly. Also feel free to raise any feature requests and recommendations at your leasure.

### Overall Project Goals
The project scope is very much subject to change during the development process, but I am working towards some general design goals, that the finished product should fulfill:

- Create a sidescrolling RPG-style game
    - Game elements should reflect aspects normally associated with elements of a resume, including but not limited to:
        - Work experience
        - Academic achievements
        - Hobbies
        - Personal traits
        - Language proficiency (both traditional and programming languages)
- Ensure proper project documentation, using best practice git version control
    - Raise issues for any feature that is to be added/revised
    - Create dedicated branches for each issue
    - Document the development process in the comments
    - State clear requirements and deliverables
    - Never push directly to main branch
- Setup proper workflow in order to have the game go live on website
    - As soon as a minimum viable product is obtained, the game should move away from local servers and onto the website.
    - Preferrably the website/production code should automatically update from the github main branch (No idea how that works yet).
